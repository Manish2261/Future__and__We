              <p>In India, annually nearly 5,00,000 road-accidents occurs accounting to 1,50,000 precious lives. Hence, my team's aim was to reduce nearly 75% of such road-accidents occuring to multiple reason, which majorly caused by Driver's Fault, Road-Ragging, Mishap occuring at Blind Spots majorly and upon complete development would eradicate the oportunities for theives to steal our vehicle.
