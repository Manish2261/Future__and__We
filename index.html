    <h1>Future & We</h1>
    <h2>Why the name Future & We?</h2>
     <p>Hello All, I'm Manish, Thank you for taking your time to view my work.Coming back to the answer, Since my graduation days, I always
        wanted to be with the future and the best way possible for these was to built a community or a interface where we could be connected
        to each other. But many plan remains as plan until an action takes place. But now as i think, Data Science is all about our future as
        we are today itself catering data and trying to make our future more free and connected. </p>
    
    <h2>My Mission:</h2>
     <p>I believe that:

                "Presence of Mind Indicates Degree of Actions"
        
        I want to contribute my part of work in building our future, Briefly I want to be the part of future where I will be significantly
        contributing for the betterment of our anthropological existence.</p>
    
     <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am Manish, once I was reading a weekly blog from the <a target="_blank" href="(https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10154038228536961
      )">"Gate Note's"</a> where Mr. Bill Gates and Dr. Siddharth Mukherjee were discussing on the evolutionary deveopment of "Data Science 
      and Ml" for treating the victims of "Cancers" and also for <a target="_blank" href="(https://www.amazon.in/Gene-Intimate-History-
      Siddhartha-Mukherjee-ebook/dp/B06XY1PDMV)">"Concept of Programmed Baby"</a> which I read and got my Dot Connected as we say. Thus I 
      was very inquisitive for being the part of our great future coming ahead and thus I crawlingly started working towards it. But now 
      during this pandemic, where I was also ablazed by it's grunt, decided to start once again, and thus now I am working towards my long 
      standing goal to be the part of future.</p>

      <p>I am a inquisitive, w.r.to my curiosity for finding the diamond out of the received info but highly credulous in taking bold and 
      legitimate decision required to improve the performance of systems under mine vigilance. I strongly beleive that if we could connect
      Data Science with the Hardwares, we could create wonders. Autonomous Vehicles, and Humanoid robot are some of these wonders which we
      are developing.</p>
