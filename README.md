# Welcome to Future__and__We

### Why the name Future__and__We?

Hello All, I'm Manish, Thank you for taking your time to view my work.  
Coming back to the answer, Since my graduation days, I always waanted to be with the future and the best way possible for these was to built a community or a interface where we could be connected to each other. But many plan remains as plan until an action takes place.
But now as i think, Data Science is all about our future as we are today itself catering data and trying to make our future more free and connected.


## My Mission:

I believe that:

## _Presence of Mind Indicates Degree of Actions_ ##

I want to contribute my part of work in building our future, Briefly I want to be the part of future where I will be significantly contributing for the betterment of our anthropological existence.
