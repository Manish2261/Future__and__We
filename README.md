Why the name Future__and__We?
Hello All, I'm Manish, Thank you for taking your time to view my work.
Coming back to the answer, Since my graduation days, I always waanted to be with the future and the best way possible for these was to built
a community or a interface where we could be connected to each other. But many plan remains as plan until an action takes place. But now as 
i think, Data Science is all about our future as we are today itself catering data and trying to make our future more free and connected.

My Mission:

I believe that:
/"Presence of Mind Indicates Degree of Actions/"

I want to contribute my part of work in building our future, Briefly I want to be the part of future where I will be significantly contributing
for the betterment of our anthropological existence.

### About Me

I am Manish, once I was reading a weekly blog from the [Gate Notes](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10154038228536961) where Mr. Bill Gates and Dr. Siddharth Mukherjee were discussing on theevolutionary deveopment of "Data Science and Ml" for treating the victims of "Cancers" and also for [Infant Gene Editing](https://www.amazon.in/Gene-Intimate-History-Siddhartha-Mukherjee-ebook/dp/B06XY1PDMV) which I read and got my Dot Connected as we say. Thus I was very inquisitive for being the part of our great future coming ahead and thus I crawlingly started working towards it. But now during this pandemic, where I was also ablazed by it's grunt, decided to start once again, and thus now I am working towards my long standing goal to be the part of future.

I am a inquisitive, w.r.to my curiosity for finding the diamond out of the received info but highly credulous in taking bold and legitimate 
decision required to improve the performance of systems under mine vigilance. I strongly beleive that if we could connect Data Science with 
the Hardwares, we could create wonders. Autonomous Vehicles, and Humanoid robot are some of these wonders which we are developing.
